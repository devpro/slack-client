Devpro Slack Client
===================

This is a very basic command line tool (.NET Console Application) that is able to send notifications to a given Slack channel.
It's used in my company to update a channel everytime a deployment is done on one of our environment.

TODO:
- Continuous integration with Travis or appveyor
- Document a little ^^
- Be able to create an installer through one command line (Wix?)
